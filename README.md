### Abstract
This is a project for our Big Data course and our project focuses on analyzing and trying to predict flight's cancellation and delay. The project divides into the EDA part and modeling part. In the EDA part, we utilized PySpark and Graph Theory for analyzing how different aspects of a flight including: Origin, Destination, Time, Airline,etc can affect cancellation and delay. 


In the modeling part, we tried to predict if a flight will get cancelled or not and how long the delay might be if a flight is not cancelled. Our main goal is to find out the key factors that lead to cancellation and delay.

### Data Sources:
This project uses the Flight arrival and departure data for all commercial flights within the USA from October 1987 to April 2008. It has total of 120 million records which is about 21GB.
